Behavior of sizeof operator 

// 1st program to show that array and pointers are different
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main()
{
    int arr[] = { 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 };
    int* ptr = arr;
 
    // sizof(int) * (number of element in arr[]) is printed
    cout << "Size of arr[] " << sizeof(arr) << "\n";
 
    // sizeof a pointer is printed which is same for all
    // type of pointers (char *, void *, etc)
    cout << "Size of ptr " << sizeof(ptr);
    return 0;
}

Output
Size of arr[] 24
Size of ptr 8

Assigning any address to an array variable is not allowed. 

// IInd program to show that array and pointers are different
#include <stdio.h>
 
int main()
{
   int arr[] = {10, 20}, x = 10;
   int *ptr = &x; // This is fine
   arr = &x;  // Compiler Error
   return 0;
}

Output: 

 Compiler Error: incompatible types when assigning to 
              type 'int[2]' from type 'int *'
